The mountains, fields and forest are strong characteristics of the site for the 2000m² high-end single-family residence in Schaan, Liechtenstein. The project features generous living areas, lush gardens, iconic entertainment spaces and spa & health facilities.

Oppenheim Architecture’s sensitivity to quality, scale and integration is highly embedded in this project. The expansive program is broken down to small and playful volumes, creating a small village embedded within nature. Alpine Oasis further blurs the boundaries between nature and man by integrating the physical context with the architecture. As a result, the interior spaces pull in Schaan’s iconic woodland, fields and mountains.
